"Topology describes the relationships between points, lines and polygons that "
"represent the features of a geographic region. With the Topology Checker "
"plugin you can look over your vector files and check the topology with "
"several topology rules. These rules check with spatial relations whether "
"your features 'Equal', 'Contain', 'Cover', are 'CoveredBy', 'Cross', "
"'Disjoint', 'Intersect', 'Overlap', 'Touches' and are 'Within' each other. "
"It depends on your individual questions which topology rules you apply to "
"your vector data. E.g. normally you won't accept overshoots in line layers "
"but if they depict dead-end streets you won't remove them from your vector "
"layer."

"QGIS has the built-in topological editing feature which is great for "
