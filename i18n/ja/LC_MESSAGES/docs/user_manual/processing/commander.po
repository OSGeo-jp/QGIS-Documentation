"The commander is started from the *Analysis* menu or, more practically, "
"pressing :kbd:`Shift + Ctrl + M` (you can change that default keyboard "
"shortcut in the QGIS configuration if you prefer a different one). Apart "
"from executing SEXTANTE algorithms, the commander gives you access to most "
"of the functionality in QGIS, which means that it gives you a practical and "
"efficient way of running QGIS tasks, and allows you to control QGIS reducing "
"the usage of buttons and menus."
