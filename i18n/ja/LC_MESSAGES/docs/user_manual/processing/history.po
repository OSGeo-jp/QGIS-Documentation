"Every time you execute an algorithm, information about the process is stored "
"in the history manager. Along with the parameters used, the date and time of "

"The  history manager is a set of registry entries grouped according to their "
"date of execution, making it easier to find information about an algorithm "
"executed at any particular moment."

"Process information is kept as a command-line expression, even if the "
"algorithm was launched from the toolbox. This makes it also useful for those "
"learning how to use the command-line interface, since they can call an "
"algorithm using the toolbox and then check the history manager to see how "
"that same algorithm could be called from the command line."

"Along with algorithm executions, the processing framework communicates with "
"the user using the other groups of the registry, namely :guilabel:`Errors`, :"
"guilabel:`Warnings` and :guilabel:`Information`. In case something is not "
"working properly, having a look at the :guilabel:`Errors` might help you to "
"see what is happening. If you get in contact with a developer to report a "
"bug or error, the information in that group will be very useful for him to "
"find out what is going wrong."

"When executing third party algorithms, this is usually done calling their "
"command-line interfaces, which communicate with the user using the console. "
"Although that console is not shown, a full dump of it is stored in the :"
"guilabel:`Information` group each time you run one of those algorithms. If, "
"for instance, you are having problems executing a SAGA algorithm, look for "
"an entry name 'SAGA execution console output' to check all the messages "
"generated by SAGA and try to find out where the problem is."

"Some algorithms, even if they can produce a result with the given input "

"having unexpected results."
