"There are four basic elements in the framework GUI, which are used to run "
"algorithms for different purposes. Choosing one tool or another will depend "
"on the kind of analysis that is to be performed and the particular "
"characteristics of each user and project. All of them (except for the batch "
"processing interface, which is called from the toolbox, as we will see) can "
"be accessed from the :menuselection:`Processing` menu item (you will see "
"more than four entries. The remaining ones are not used to execute "
"algorithms and will be explained later in this chapter)."
